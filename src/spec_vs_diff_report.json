  "summary": "The diff only updates project_state.json with planning/metadata entries and does not perform any deployment, verification, or provide a live IC URL. It also violates the constraint/AC that no project files be modified.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Deploy the existing project to the Internet Computer as-is (frontend static assets + backend canister) using the repository’s current files, dependencies, configuration, and folder structure, without modifying any code/assets/config/structure; site publicly accessible on IC mainnet.",
      "reason": "No deployment-related files or configuration changes are shown, and no evidence of deploying frontend + backend canisters or making the site publicly accessible is present in the diff summary.",
