      "reason": "The diff shows some image URLs/paths (e.g., Home hero uses a generated asset, Home featured destinations use Unsplash, Honeymoon uses a mix of generated + Unsplash), but the summary does not provide a complete inventory across all pages/sections/cards to verify the global \"no repeats\" constraint.",
