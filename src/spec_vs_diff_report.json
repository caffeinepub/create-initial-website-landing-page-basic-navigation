  "summary": "Core deployment requirements were not implemented: no root-level dfx.json was added, no frontend/package.json was added, and there’s no evidence of DFX frontend asset canister build steps being configured to run the Vite build and serve frontend/dist. DEPLOYMENT.md was expanded, but it references a workflow that depends on missing repo files/config. Some unrequested Vite configuration changes were made.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add a root-level dfx.json defining a Motoko backend canister (backend/main.mo) and a static asset frontend canister serving frontend/dist.",

      "reason": "DEPLOYMENT.md was modified, but it references steps assuming the presence of new dfx.json and frontend/package.json; those files are not present in the diff. Also the file content is truncated, so completeness cannot be confirmed from provided evidence.",
