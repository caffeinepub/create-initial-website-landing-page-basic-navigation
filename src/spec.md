## Summary
**Goal:** Deliver a complete, premium-feeling Archiv Agency travel website with fully working routes/navigation, consistent theme-color branding, unique travel imagery, and the required content/feature set across all pages.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix/verify routing so Home (/) is the default and all top-nav routes render correctly: /, /about, /tour-guide, /services, /tour-packages, /vehicles, /honeymoon-offers, /booking.
- Implement the exact navbar labels and order on desktop and mobile: Home, About, Tour Guide, Services, Tour Packages, Vehicles, Honeymoon Offers, Booking.
- Update brand copy: set backend site tagline to “Your Trusted Partner for Unforgettable Travel Experiences” and ensure the Home hero prominently shows “Explore the World With Archiv Agency”; ensure brand name displays as “Archiv Agency”.
- Ensure every page/section/card uses unique high-quality travel imagery (stock-style) with no repeated images across the site (including guides/packages/vehicles grids).
- Apply a consistent premium/luxury UI system site-wide (typography, spacing, card styles, subtle animations) and keep all pages/sections non-empty.
- Make theme color presets drive branding consistently across all pages (navbar accents, buttons, icons, badges/tags, links/hover, highlighted headings), removing page-specific hardcoded palettes; persist selection across reload.
- Home page: implement hero (tagline + CTA), featured destinations (multiple cards with unique images), and an offers banner section with unique imagery and promo copy.
- Add a responsive testimonials slider (at minimum on Home) with multiple testimonials and smooth transitions.
- Booking page: keep a simple booking form, add a WhatsApp contact button with a prefilled message (including selected package when present), and show a confirmation message after submit.
- Add a contact section with a contact form and a responsive Google Map iframe embed, reachable from the site (e.g., Home and/or footer).
- Add smooth scrolling for in-page navigation/CTAs and ensure mobile responsiveness across navbar, grids, cards, and forms.
- SEO/performance hygiene: update HTML title + essential meta tags (description, og:title, og:description) for Archiv Agency; ensure images use appropriate sizing/loading where applicable.
- Footer: add a professional footer with social media icon links (placeholders) that open externally without breaking SPA navigation.

**User-visible outcome:** Users land on a polished Archiv Agency Home page by default, can navigate all required pages from the top menu without errors, see premium visuals with unique imagery throughout, customize theme colors site-wide, browse testimonials, submit booking/contact forms, open WhatsApp with a prefilled booking message, and view SEO-friendly pages with a professional footer and responsive map/contact section.
